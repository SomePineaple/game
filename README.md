This is a project im working on where im trying to create the same type of game in a couple of different languadges, python was first, then java, and finally c++. The SDL_Game directory is c++, Game is python, and src/me/somepineaple/game is the java src. to compile the c++ version run the build script, then execute ./game from that directory.
